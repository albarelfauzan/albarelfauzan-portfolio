## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of ArtBeat, one major challenge was integrating the blockchain-based NFT certificate with our Express.js backend, as well as optimizing the Next.js frontend for smooth wallet connectivity and smart contract interactions. Through this process, we learned how to design more efficient smart contracts, structure a reliable backend flow for NFT minting, and handle various edge cases related to blockchain transactions. we also gained valuable experience blending decentralized tools with traditional web technologies while improving teamwork, iteration, and rapid problem-solving throughout the project.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional platform that allows users to mint verified NFT certificates for their artworks. The final product delivered a smooth end-to-end experience, improved system reliability, and demonstrated a successful blend of modern web development with decentralized technologies.
