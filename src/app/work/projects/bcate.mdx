## Overview

BCate is a blockchain-powered platform designed to create a secure and transparent marketplace for architectural and interior design works. It empowers designers to mint their blueprints and designs as NFTs, ensuring intellectual property protection, provenance tracking, and monetization opportunities. On the buyer side, users can browse, request custom designs, chat with architects, and purchase exclusive digital or physical renderings, all while retaining clarity around usage rights.

## Key Features

- **NFT Blueprint Ownership**: Designers can mint architectural and interior design blueprints as NFTs, ensuring secure proof of ownership and protected intellectual property.
- **Design Marketplace**: Users can browse, purchase, and request custom architectural or interior design services directly from verified designers.
- **Project Collaboration & Chat**: A built-in chat system allows clients and designers to communicate, share ideas, and refine project requirements in real time.
- **Transparent Licensing & Usage Rights**: Each purchased design comes with clearly defined usage rights stored on-chain, ensuring fair, transparent, and traceable transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For designing UI layouts, components, and interactive prototypes that guide the development process.
- **React and Next.js**: For building a fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly user interface with streamlined client–server rendering.
- **Express.js**: For handling backend APIs, authentication, and server-side logic to support secure and scalable platform operations.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building BCate came with several challenges, particularly in integrating on-chain ownership logic with a traditional web architecture using Next.js and Express.js. Ensuring smooth communication between the client, backend, and blockchain required careful handling of wallet states, authorization, and data consistency. Throughout the process, I gained deeper insight into structuring secure API flows, designing more intuitive user journeys in Figma, and optimizing UI performance for real-time interactions. This project also strengthened my ability to blend decentralized features with a modern web stack while maintaining a clean and user-friendly experience.

## Outcome

The project produced a fully functional platform where designers can securely tokenize their architectural works and users can seamlessly browse, request, and purchase designs with clear on-chain ownership. The final product improved workflow transparency, enhanced user trust, and demonstrated an effective integration of modern web development with blockchain-based intellectual property protection.
