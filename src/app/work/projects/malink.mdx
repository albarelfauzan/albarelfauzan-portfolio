## Overview

MaLink is a blockchain-based protocol that enables automatic, scheduled cryptocurrency transfers — helping users set up recurring payments or transfer funds at a predetermined time. It solves a common crypto pain point: the risk of losing assets when seed phrases are forgotten or wallets become inactive. The system empowers users to automate tasks like subscription payments, payroll transfers, or even one-time inheritance-style payouts, all while keeping the process secure, non-custodial, and accessible to both crypto novices and experienced users.

## Key Features

- **Automated Crypto Transfers**: Users can schedule one-time or recurring crypto payments that execute automatically without manual intervention.
- **Non-Custodial Security**: Funds remain in the user’s own wallet, ensuring full control and enhanced safety without relying on third-party custody.
- **Backup & Inactivity Protection**: The system provides safeguards for cases where a wallet becomes inactive or inaccessible, helping prevent asset loss over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Utilized for planning user journeys and designing clear, minimal interfaces that simplify complex crypto operations.
- **React and Next.js**: Used to build a responsive dashboard and seamless user flow, enabling real-time interaction with scheduled transactions and wallet states.
- **Express.js**: Implemented to manage API routes, handle automation logic, and ensure reliable communication between the frontend, blockchain services, and scheduling engine.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing MaLink posed several challenges, especially in ensuring reliable automation for scheduled crypto transfers without compromising security or user control. Coordinating the frontend, backend, and blockchain actions required careful handling of timing logic, wallet connections, and fail-safe mechanisms for inactive accounts. Through this project, we learned how to design clearer user flows for complex crypto features, structure backend services that support automated tasks, and optimize communication between Next.js, Express.js, and blockchain networks. The experience strengthened our ability to build secure, user-friendly systems that operate seamlessly in decentralized environments.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a secure and fully operational platform that allows users to automate their crypto transfers with confidence and ease. It successfully delivered a smooth scheduling experience, improved asset safety through inactivity protection, and showcased an effective integration of modern web technologies with blockchain-based automation.
